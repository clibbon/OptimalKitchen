# Optimise your Kitchen
In a needlessly complex way. This project aims to provide an optimal arrangement for your kitchen, based on provided information about the layout, the things you wish to store, and the 'user journeys' you make. An example (for my own kitchen) is provided in the "example" folder, as well as optimise.ipynb which demonstrates how I set up my own kitchen.
